Contains following algorithms:

- FiveRegionStereo - Heiko Hirschmuller, Peter R. Innocent, and Jon Garibaldi. "Real-Time Correlation-Based Stereo Vision with Reduced Border Errors."
- DisparityPropagationStereo - Sun, et al. "Real-time local stereo via edge-aware propagation"

- SADBoxMedian - SAD matching, box aggregating, WTA, median filter postprocessing

Works only for grayscale images. Some adaptation is made in these algorithms and there also might be some bugs.
